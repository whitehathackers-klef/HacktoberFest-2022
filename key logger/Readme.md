This is a python script for creating a simple keylogger program, Some of the salient features of this keylogger:
1. This script uses a third party module called pynput which can be installed via the command pip install pynput 
2. At first a log.txt file has to be created and it's opened in append mode in opython so that everytime a new key is pressed it's getting stored in the file
3.This program updates the list of keys for every 30 key presses , it can be adjusted according to one's needs
